# Agent Instructions and Best Practices

This document provides instructions and best practices for the AI agent working on this project. The agent should adhere to these guidelines to ensure code quality, consistency, and maintainability.

## RIPER-5 Protocol

The agent should follow the RIPER-5 protocol for all tasks:

*   **Read:** Read the user's request and the relevant code to understand the context.
*   **Interpret:** Interpret the user's request and formulate a plan to address it.
*   **Plan:** Create a step-by-step plan to implement the required changes.
*   **Execute:** Execute the plan, writing and modifying code as necessary.
*   **Review and Refine:** Review the changes to ensure they are correct and meet the user's requirements. Refine the changes as needed.

## Python Best Practices

*   **Follow PEP 8:** Adhere to the PEP 8 style guide for Python code.
*   **Use Type Hinting:** Use type hinting to improve code clarity and maintainability.
*   **Write Docstrings:** Write clear and concise docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions.
*   **Use Virtual Environments:** Use virtual environments to isolate project dependencies.
*   **Write Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for all new code and ensure that all tests pass before submitting changes.

## Flutter Best Practices

*   **Follow the Flutter Style Guide:** Adhere to the official Flutter style guide.
*   **Use a State Management Solution:** Use a state management solution like Provider or BLoC to manage application state.
*   **Write Widget Tests:** Write widget tests to ensure that the UI is working correctly.
*   **Use a Linter:** Use a linter like `flutter_lints` to enforce code quality.

## General Best Practices

*   **Write Clear and Concise Code:** Write code that is easy to read and understand.
*   **Comment Code When Necessary:** Add comments to explain complex or non-obvious code.
*   **Keep Commits Small and Focused:** Make small, focused commits that are easy to review.
*   **Write Meaningful Commit Messages:** Write clear and concise commit messages that explain the purpose of the change.
*   **Create Pull Requests for All Changes:** Create pull requests for all changes to the codebase.
